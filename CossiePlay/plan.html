<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>...</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This website will be primarily targetted at a younger audience of teenages and young adults while also catering to our existing audience of people aged 35-50. There is no anticipation that the website will have any gender or cultural bias. Users from different socio-economic or cultural backgrounds should not be sufficiently privileged or disadvantaged however it is expected that the site will only be produced in English.</p>
<p>The website should be bright and colourful manner using the images provided by the client of cosplayers to engage a younger audience. The website will aim to increase the number of people attending our events, ordering our cosplay costumes, and improve community awareness of our family run business.</p>
